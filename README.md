# Data preparation for 366dailystoic.com
I built [366dailystoic.com](https://366dailystoic.com) to get some more practice with deploying websites from a vps (read more about it in the blog post [How to deploy a Node.js website with Nginx and Systemd on a VPS](deploy-nodejs-website-with-nginx-and-systemd-on-a-vps.md)

# Run
```
node scripts/parseBook.js
```
